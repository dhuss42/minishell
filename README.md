#minishell

## Project overview

For this project, we developed a custom Unix shell, similar in functionality to bash. Our shell can execute commands interactively, manage multiple processes, and supports essential features such as piping, input/output redirection, and environment variable handling. It also includes built-in commands like 'echo', 'cd', and 'pwd', while accurately managing system signals, such as ctrl-C to interrupt processes and ctrl-D to exit the shell.

This project was the first team-based assignment at 42, requiring us to collaborate effectively with Git for version control, strengthening both our technical skills in systems programming and teamwork in software development.
